# Security Policy

## Overview
The "NTM from Scratch" project aims to build a Neural Turing Machine (NTM) from scratch, starting from individual neurons to fully integrating an NTM. While this project primarily serves as a learning tool, we take security and responsible disclosure seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you identify any potential vulnerabilities within the codebase or related resources, please follow these steps:

1. **Email Us:** Send a detailed report to `abhshkpandey01@gmail.com`. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including:
   - A description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - The impact of the vulnerability, if known
   - Suggested remediation, if available

2. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days and keep you updated on our progress.

3. **Resolution:** After confirming and addressing the vulnerability, we will release a fix and provide a detailed changelog describing the updates.

## Security Best Practices
This project is intended to be a foundational educational resource in neural network and NTM design, and we recommend users:

- Regularly review and update code to mitigate potential security issues.
- Ensure that sensitive or private information is not inadvertently shared within code or documentation.
- Use appropriate security settings in any software environments where the project may be deployed.

## Supported Versions
We recommend using the most recent version of this project for the best security practices and vulnerability fixes. Older versions may not receive updates or patches.

## Thank You
We appreciate the responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities. Security is a community effort, and your input is invaluable in maintaining a safe, reliable project.
